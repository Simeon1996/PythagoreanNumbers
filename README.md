# PythagoreanNumbers
George likes math. Recently he discovered an interesting property of the Pythagorean Theorem: there are infinite number of triples of integers a, b and c (a ≤ b), such that a2 + b2 = c2. Write a program to help George find all such triples (called Pythagorean numbers) among a set of integer numbers.

Input
The input data should be read from the console. At the first line, we have a number n – the count of the input numbers. At the next n lines we have n different integers.
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

Output
Print at the console all Pythagorean equations a2 + b2 = c2 (a ≤ b), which can be formed by the input numbers. Each equation should be printed in the following format: "a*a + b*b = c*c". The order of the equations is not important. Beware of spaces: put spaces around the "+" and "=". In case of no Pythagorean numbers found, print "No".
